So sánh Clone và Fork & Pull Request

(Clone)
(Account A) Remote Repo -> (Account B) Direct Connection -> Local Copy (git clone) -> Push to Remote Repo -> ...

(Fork & Pull Request)
(Account A) Remote Repo - Remote Copy (Fork on GitHub) -> (Account B) Remote Repo -> Direct Connection -> Local Copy (git clone) -> Push to Remote Repo - Create Pull Request -> Remote Repo -> Accept Pull Request -> Merge -> ...

- Với Clone, nếu muốn thêm Commit vào Remote Repo (Account A), (Account B) cần là Collaborator, Organization Member, Team Member; còn với Fork & Pull Request thì không
